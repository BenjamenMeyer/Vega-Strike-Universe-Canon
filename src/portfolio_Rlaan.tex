Rlaan ships and installations are bioengineered and are living organisms; they possess lightning fast reason-processing and reflex mechanisms though they all operate at the instinctual level (less a brain than a microchip). Although living, they contain no self-awareness and as such are supposed to be treated only as machines (in the current sense of the metaphor; as the Mechanists, the Unadorned, and the Andolians treat machines quite differently... not to mention the sentient "machines" themselves, the Unadorned Servant AI, the Mechanist Advanced AI, and the Andolian Purth) - mostly due to Rlaan expertise at creating complex instinctual neural pathways and their express lack of interest in creating sentience from nothing. Humans and pilots of other species, however, impart (erroneously) a sinister though coldly impartial personification of the Rlaan ships' minds and prefer to steer clear of piloting any of them. Nevertheless, any sentient or sub-sentient (the use of the term sub-sentient itself is debatable ;) ) being can easily pilot any of the Rlaan ships through a variety of interfaces available by specification growth.

Key Features:

A. Listed below are the basic required features of all Rlaan ships:

	1. Absence of visible incendiary means of propulsion.
	
	2. Presence of radiator/shield manipulator fins. Please take note that the fins must be 	accurate indicators of ship size. 
	
		Hence larger ships will have
		
		a) fins with a higher number of ribs (Fig.~\ref{fig:rlaan-fins}); or
		
		b) a larger number of fins, present in tiers if possible, i.e. dorsal piscine fins in 		contrast to the jutting lateral piscine fins of fighters and smaller ships.

3. Basic form is smooth and flowing, totally organic. Bilateral symmetry is a requirement 	for most of their ships. Bilateral symmetry is indicative to Rlaans of speed and agility (and 	also of 	spuriousness, contrasting their own lumbering radial symmetry - symbolic of 	precision and versatility - to the more common bilateral symmetry of other known species. 	Hence a bilaterally symmetrical vehicle is as attractive to an Rlaan as a sports car is to a 	human). Radially symmetrical ships do exist, though most are inexpensive civilian 	transports and utility ships.

\subsection{Stations Listing}

Note: For modelers wondering about the list of the Rlaan stations, there are none. Stations are not named, in the way ships are. But if you insist... ;) here's a list of the needed Rlaan installations. Don't worry, alien stations do not need to be necessarily obvious as to their functions, so if your station model looks Rlaan, it would certainly fit comfortably into any of the blank station spots. Please read guides above though for the specifics of some stations.
