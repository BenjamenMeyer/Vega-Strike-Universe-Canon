On the Rlaan, Aera, and music.

Rlaan: n.	1. 	Humanized representation of the name used by the pair of species from 	
		the 4th planet in system SCx9362.
	2.	Either of the two species from SCx9362.  Rlaan are radialy symmetric 	
		beings with a base four split.  Their workers stand about one meter high 
		at the prime knee, and are nearly one meter in diameter.  Members of 	
		their warrior caste tend towards being 50% larger in both dimensions.  	
		Rlaan natively breathe a methane-based atmosphere, and must wear 	
		special breathing apparatus to negotiate oxygen-nitrogen environments.  
		Their skeletal structure, being an exoskeletal carapace supported 	
		internally by millions of reinforcing struts, is best suited to lower 	
		gravity worlds, and leads to the use of mechanical assistance on larger 	
		or denser rocky bodies.  What is reported of Rlaan culture appears to be 
		a rather dry affair, and their music has been compared to the set of 	
		frequencies one would expect to register if a Myztherian Octpanther 	
		were let loose in a campanile.  On a more disturbing note, the Rlaan 	
		central archives possess the largest collection of data concerning Jerry 	
		Lewis and Yoko Ono outside of Human space.  The Rlaan are, 		
		however, regarded by many of the other space faring races as much 	
		more intelligent than their culture’s taste in art would suggest.

Aera: n.	1. 	A member of an intelligent centauroid species from some misbegotten 	
		hell of a jungle world orbiting SCx62381.  The Aera are oxygen-	
		nitrogen breathers, with a strong internal skeleton, smooth, ashen-gray 	
		leathery skin, a decided lack of psychiatric assistance for their 		
		obviously repressed dissatisfaction with natural ecology, and, at least 	
		according to the Cult of the Devourer on Mishtal Seven, a flavor 	
		remarkably similar to that of a human with a high protein diet, but only 	
		if both have been served with a nice Chianti.

And now, what this means about their music

The Rlaan:
“their music has been compared to the set of frequencies one would expect to register if a 
Myztherian Octpanther were let loose in a campanile”

While this, along with their fascination with Yoko Ono, assuredly brings pictures to 
mind, it does bear some explaining, given the other aspects of Rlaan psychology and 
physiology.  

Note#1 the Rlaan are hip to the base 16 thing, having 16 fingers.  This means that 
standard 4/4 2/2 2/4 etc times are reasonably compatible

Note#2 while any individual subsection of Rlaan music may sound rather dissonant and 
chaotic, they aren’t actually the most creative beings to ever wander the galaxy.  Their 
instruments tend towards simplicity of timbre, and the progressions of dissonant chunks 
progress in fairly straightforward manners. Thus, objects of primary musical interest in 
Rlaan music are the arrangements, which are bizarre.

Note#3 Rlaan singing involves much buzzing and the occasional clacking of any or all of 
their 4 quad-mandible mouths.

Note#4 did I mention that the words methodical and plodding are often used to describe
the Rlaan? This despite their tendency to produce cacophony. Such dissonance is said to 
be the source of what passes for Rlaan creativity.

The Aera:

“a decided lack of psychiatric assistance for their obviously repressed dissatisfaction with 
natural ecology”
This puts it mildly.  Here’s a bit of Aera history:

The Aera lived on a jungle covered planet.  Jungles have this nasty tendency to erode the 
efforts of civilization.  Thus, the Aera didn’t think much of the jungle. (It didn’t help that 
the jungle was full of nasty critters too)  So, the Aera spent much of their existence 
fighting off the jungle, sort of like the Mayans.  Eventually, ‘the jungle’ came to mean all 
the things that existed to make life more difficult for the Aera, and they fought against the 
jungle in all its forms, both physical, and ideological.  As for the real jungle,  as their 
technology progressed, they were able to push it back more and faster, and this ability of 
technology to push back the jungle made them deeply invest in the pursuit of technology 
in all its forms.  When they left their planet for space, space became the new jungle.  The 
Aera have not yet learned to trust that the universe doesn’t have it out for them.  

Somewhat angsty, but neither particularly angry or particularly whiny, somewhat bitter, 
but definitely not morose.  Determined as all hell, and entirely willing to kick your ass if 
you’re in their way.  However, far from mindless in their aggression, they are 
exceptionally organized.  Militaristic, they see no need to bicker with that which merely 
is, provided they believe it to be so, but they are relentless in their assault on that which 
they see as the opposition to their existence, which is an admittedly somewhat broader 
range of things than most humans would see fit to classify as such.


Notes on the Aera:

#1 The Aera have 3 fingers on each hand, 2 arms with hands, and 4 legs (a leg being an 
arm with a foot instead of a hand ?).  3’s and 6’s highly prevalent.

#2 The Aera are proud and brash.  Their music is a celebration of this. They don’t really 
dig on the whole lovesong thing, neither do they do much in the way of experimental 
music outside the scope of celebrating  technology itself.

#3 Most common theme in Aeran music: The triumph of noble effort over the dark and 
ominous jungle.
